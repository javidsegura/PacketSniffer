HOW IS THE ATTACKER ATTACKING?

The local server receives a lot of HTML packets with GET requests.
It eventually receives more data than it can handle and crashes.

All these packets are sent from the same IP address. Different users are simple different connections to the server
(from the same IP address).

Whats with the loading rate?

If too much traffic is coming from the same IP address, it is banned temporarily.


DEFENSE STRATEGY:
1. When a certain treshold of received data per sec analyse ips.
2. If an IP has sent too much data in a short period of time, it is banned temporarily.
